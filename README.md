# CollectCharger
A Mac reminder app written in Python3 to remind you about collecting your charger before you leave your workplace.

# Introduction
How often do you forget your charger (or any other item) at your workplace only to regret later? I have a pretty bad habit of forgetting my mobile charger at my desk which I only come to know about when I am in the cab on my way back home. I even forgot to take my charger with me before leaving for a week long trip to Manali :-D
Today, I wrote a tiny Python script which runs in the background and sends me a reminder at a particular time by popping up a system notification along-with a beep & speaking it out loud :-D
This script is written for Mac only but can be easily customised for any other Linux based OS.

# Usage
To run it, just copy the Python script to a directory & tuck it inside a Cron job. I leave my workplace at 14:30, so I set the Cron job as : - 
```bash
5 14 * * 1-5 /usr/local/bin/python3 /Users/admin/Desktop/PythonScripts/ChargerCollect.py >/Users/admin/Desktop/reminder_cronout.log 2>/Users/admin/Desktop/reminder_error.lo
```

This notifies me to collect my charger at 14:15 :-)
